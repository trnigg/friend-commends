After logging in successfully, the user immediately lands on the For You page where they will see any notifications for friend requests and any movies and TV shows recommended by their friends. If there is nothing showing in the new account, user can click on the hamburger icon on the top right hand corner to pull up the navbar and head over to the Friends page. <br>

Here the user can start searching for friends by name and click send friend request button. If another user has sent a friend request, the user can click on either the Accept or Decline button to respond to the request.

From the same nav bar, the user can also start searching for movies and tv shows to recommend to their friends. The three icons on the movie search result allows users to recommend the movie, share the movie with a friend or add the movie to their watch list. The same functionalities are available for the TV shows. Users can also sort the recommended movies and tv shows by order of most recent or most recommended. Alternatively, it can also be filtered by the friends.

<image src="./client/public/images/screenshot_watchlist.png" width="200" height="400" />

From the shares received list, the user can read any messages sent from their friend in relation to the movie/show and choose to add it to the watch list, re-share it or remove it. From the watch list, the user can also recommend and share the movie/show with other friend users.

We hope you enjoy playing around with this app and have fun socialising with your friends and family!
